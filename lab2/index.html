            <h2>Welcome to My Hobbies and Thoughts!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the inside my head. Bascially everything that I've done, will do, or in pursuit of doing. Also my thoughts, quotes, or words to live my. I also have some interest in coding. Which is another aspect of creating games.</p>

            <p>I go into more in depth of my hobbies on the next page. There's another hobby I forgot to mention. One is Spray painting, I picked up on it a couple a years ago but to say it's been fun has been an understatement. It has been tricky to sketch with, but if I sketch using paint brushes first, I'll use to spray painting to fill in. </p>
